- Hi, We are Pneuhaus!

- We are interested in the design and manufacturing of inflatable structures. Our studio uses many digital and physical modelling techniques to realize our designs, which we will share here.
- We are currently working on different modeling workflows in Rhino/Grasshopper to aid in our design process. We hope to share them in the future but for now will probably just be posting 3dm or stl files for 3D printing.
- We are always looking for new collaborators and ideas, feel free to get in touch!
